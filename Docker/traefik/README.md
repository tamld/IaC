## Overview
Traefik is an open-source Edge Router that makes publishing your services a fun and easy experience. It receives requests on behalf of your system and finds out which components are responsible for handling them.

## Structure
- `.env` - Environment variables for the Traefik setup
- `.env.local.example` - Example local environment variables (copy to .env.local for local overrides)
- `docker-compose.yml` - Docker Compose configuration for Traefik
- `traefik.yml` - Main Traefik static configuration
- `dynamic/` - Directory containing dynamic Traefik configurations
- `docs/` - Documentation, diagrams, and mindmaps

## Setup

1. Create a `.env.local` file based on the `.env.local.example` template
2. Update any required environment variables
3. Start Traefik using Docker Compose:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## SSL/TLS

Traefik is configured to automatically handle SSL/TLS certificates via Let's Encrypt.

## Dashboard

The Traefik dashboard is available at the path configured in your environment variables.
Default security credentials should be updated in a production environment.

## Workflow

The typical workflow for using this Traefik configuration is:

1. 🔧 **Configuration**: Set up your environment variables and customize the Traefik configuration
2. 🚀 **Deployment**: Deploy Traefik using Docker Compose
3. 🔄 **Service Registration**: Add new services by configuring labels in your Docker Compose files
4. 🔍 **Monitoring**: Use the Traefik dashboard to monitor traffic and service health

For a visual representation of the workflow, see the diagrams in the `docs` folder.

## Documentation

Additional documentation is available in the `docs` directory, including:
- Detailed setup guides
- Architecture diagrams
- Mindmaps (in markmap format)
- Configuration examples

## Notes

- Make sure to protect your `.env.local` file as it contains sensitive information
- The `acme.json` file will be created automatically to store SSL certificates
